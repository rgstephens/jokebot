## CSE Recipes
This repo is meant to be a centralized place for all CSE code examples and recipes to live.
Each branch is one example, and the branches are indexed below with a short description.

`ctrl+f` this README to find what you're looking for then checkout the relevant branch.

### Adding Examples
To add an example:

From an existing repo that you've been working on already:
* Checkout a branch with a name that doesn't exist on `cse-recipes` yet e.g. `git checkout -b my_existing_example`
* Add `cse_recipes` as a new remote e.g. `git remote add cse git@github.com:RasaHQ/cse-recipes.git`
* Add description.txt and push to the new remote e.g. `git push cse my_existing_example` (***There must be a blank newline at the end of your `description.txt` file or the README.md generation will be broken!***)

From scratch:
* Create a new branch on `cse_recipes`. You can branch off of any branch.
* Create your example code/README/etc.
* Add/edit a file called `description.txt` with a one or two line description of what's in the branch. (***There must be a blank newline at the end of your `description.txt` file or the README.md generation will be broken!***)
* Commit your code + description.txt.
(and push your branch)

The Github action defined in .github/workflows/index_branches.yml will automatically compose the descriptions of all branches
into the README on the `main` branch at 4am CET every day.
You can also [run it manually](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow#running-a-workflow)
to update it immediately.

**Branches with no `description.txt` are not included in the index. Add one if your branch should be indexed**

To modify the branch indexing action itself, modify it on main, or on a separate branch then PR into main.
